# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Project

## Summary

This project showcases practical examples of using JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interaction with external APIs. It includes a series of scripts that perform data fetching operations and dynamically update the HTML document structure based on the received data. Through these exercises, the project demonstrates essential JavaScript skills such as asynchronous programming with the Fetch API, promise handling, and event-driven script execution.
